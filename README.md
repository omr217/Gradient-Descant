# Pipe Cost Prediction Using Gradient Descent

This project implements a **linear regression model** using the **gradient descent algorithm** to predict the cost of a pipe based on its length.

-

## 📈 Problem Statement

Given a dataset with pipe lengths and their corresponding costs, this script finds the best-fit line using gradient descent to minimize the cost function.
